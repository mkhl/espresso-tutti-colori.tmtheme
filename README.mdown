Espresso.tmTheme
================

A [TextMate][] theme based on the default [Espresso][] theme.

I really like the default Espresso colors, so I created a theme from them to
keep me warm while the amount of Sugar for it increases to comfortable levels
;-)

Installation
------------

Just double-click or `open` the `Espresso.tmTheme` file and TextMate will take
care of installing it for you.
